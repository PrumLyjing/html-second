<h1>Why I Did all of These Instead of Having Fun?</h1>

<h2>Why I started stock trading, coding, desperately earning money, study really hard, why? It is because I have specific goals.</h2>

<p>
  My goals aren't easy to accomplish so, I have to start off young and work my butt off. I want to make my goals be fulfilled, dreams come true, and worth the hopes and all my determinations.
